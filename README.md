* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

Fellow students have put together a guide to Windows set-up for the project [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Kidnapped_Vehicle_Windows_Setup.pdf) if the environment you have set up for the Sensor Fusion projects does not work for this project. There's also an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3).

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Steering and Speeding Contollers

In this solution, two PID controllers are being used to produce a stable maneuver for our car. Alongside steering for maneuvering a vehicle, it makes more sense to control the speed in order to make a smoother driving. In a real world, driver usually reduce the speed of vehicle as a proportion of steering. The more a car steered, the more driver reduce the speed. Here the error that I used to provide the controller to correct it is the tangential component of the speed using the steering angle. As The result of simulation shows when the CTE is relatively big, then steering angle increases, therefore tangential velocity increases. A PID controller for speed in this case tries to reduce speed accordingly.

## PID Coefficients Tuning

For tuning I used an initial PID coefficients using an in-python-implemented twiddle algorithm, however it was not perfect, as the modeled car was not the same as the model which is used in the simulator. The result was oscillating that can be caused either by high Kd or Ki. I reduced them in a trial-and-error effort. But still at high bending parts of the road, steering was acting with delay and big overshoots. A high Kd could solve this problem verry well. 
For speed controller I used the same logic.
